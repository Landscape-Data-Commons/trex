\arguments{
\item{mlra}{Character string or vector of character strings or \code{NULL}. The Major Land Resource Area (MLRA) or MLRAs to query. Only records from these MLRAs will be returned. If \code{NULL}, then data from all MLRAs in EDIT will be returned (WARNING: Returning data from all MLRAs is extremely slow with this function).}

\item{keys}{Optional character vector. A character vector of all the values to search for in \code{key_type}. The returned data will consist only of records where \code{key_type} contained one of the key values, but there may be keys that return no records. If \code{NULL} then the entire table will be returned. Defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{key_type}{Optional character string. Variable to query using \code{keys}. Valid key_types are: precipitation, frostFreeDays, elevation, slope, landform, parentMaterialOrigin, parentMaterialKind, and surfaceTexture . Defaults to \code{NULL}}

\item{key_chunk_size}{Numeric. The number of keys to send in a single query. Very long queries fail, so the keys may be chunked into smaller queries with the results of all the queries being combined into a single output. Defaults to \code{100}.}

\item{timeout}{Numeric. The number of seconds to wait for a nonresponse from the API before considering the query to have failed. Defaults to \code{60}.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} then the function will report additional diagnostic messages as it executes. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{data_type}{Restricted character string. One of "rangeland", "overstory", or "understory". The type of data to be returned.}

\item{ecosystem_state_sequence}{Optional numeric. The sequence code assigned to ecosystem state. Typically, this should be left NULL. Defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{land_use_sequence}{Optional numeric. The sequence code assigned to land use. Typically, this should be left NULL. Defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{community_sequence}{Optional numeric. The sequence code assigned to plant community. Typically, this should be left NULL. Defaults to \code{NULL}.}
}
\value{
A data frame of ecological site ID records meeting the parameters defined by \code{keys} and \code{key_type}.

A data frame with the requested EDIT data.

A data frame containing rangeland community composition data.
